Portability bug.  My spawn commands are executing ".../.bin/eslint", but that is a UNIX shell
script.  Need to execute .../eslint/bin/eslint.js.

Don't do syntax checking if file doesn't end in '.js'

Add a "=" keyword in uploadmap.txt file for when want the source file path used precisely
(i.e. don't strip off file path).
