# Config file for 'snUpload' that maps files to target SN records and field.
# Comment lines must begin with #
# Empty lines ignored
# Limitations:  # only honored as very first char on line,
# keyvalue may be special constant * or <, with meanings:
#  * = same as datafile value (with directory path removed, if any),
#  < = basename of datafile (i.e. without directory path and suffix).
# We always write content records using DOS \r\n EOLs, but we correctly
# handle either style of EOL for local data files and existing server values.

# As an example of special contants, if we had keyvalue of <
# for the subdir/gplay.txt line below, that would attempt to upload to
# a record with key value of "gplay".

# Specifications lines must have 4 tokens in this order:
#   datafile table datafield keyfield kevalue

#datafile        table        datafield  keyfield  kevalue
play.js          u_text_file  u_content  u_path    *
subdir/gplay.txt u_text_file  u_content  u_path    global-play.txt
