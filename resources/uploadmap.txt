# Config file for 'snUpload' that maps files to target SN records and field.
# Comment lines must begin with #

# Limitations:  # only honored as very first char on line.
# localFileSpec values are for matching against the user-specified upload file path.
#    Since upload calls use (local) relative paths, the localFileSpecs are either
#    local relative file paths; or a regular expression matching the same.
#    Regular expression localFileSpecs are coded like '/expr/' or '/expr/i'.
#    No literal space or tab characters allowed inside /regexp/s.
# keyvalue values may be special constant * or <, with meanings:
#  * = same as datafile value (with directory path removed, if any),
#  < = basename of datafile (i.e. without directory path and suffix).
#  / = datafile with directory path but without suffix).
#  # = datafile value exactly
# As an example of special keyvalue constants, if we had keyvalue of <
# for the subdir/gplay.txt line below, that would attempt to upload to
# a record with key value of "gplay".

# If more than one map entry matches the specified path, then the first
# qualifying record will be used.

# In nearly all cases, you can easily narrow to your single target record by
# using 'keyfield' of the table's display field or "name", with sys_scope
# specified where there are alternate records for different sys_scopes.
# You could always set 'keyfield' to "sys_id".

# Specifications lines must have 5 or 6 tokens in this order:
#   localFileSpec table datafield keyfield kevalue [sys_scope]

#localFileSpec   table        datafield  keyfield  keyvalue     sys_scope
